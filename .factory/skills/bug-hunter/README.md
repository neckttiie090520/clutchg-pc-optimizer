## New in This Update

This release is a reliability hardening pass — 11 bugs fixed, 10 previously-failing tests now pass, and the full pipeline is more robust end-to-end.

- **`High` severity works everywhere.** All JSON schemas, severity ranking, and payload-guard templates now recognize `High` — previously only `Critical`, `Medium`, and `Low` were accepted, silently dropping valid findings.
- **Confidence threshold is fully wired.** `--confidence-threshold` now propagates from the CLI through the orchestrator to `record-findings`. Previously the flag was parsed but never forwarded, always defaulting to 75.
- **Shell injection fixed in doc-lookup.** Library names passed to `chub` CLI are now properly shell-quoted — prevents command injection via crafted library names.
- **SIGKILL timer leak fixed.** The failsafe kill timer in `runCommandOnce` is now cleared on normal exit — previously it could fire after the child had already exited.
- **Modern Bun lockfile support.** `dep-scan.cjs` now detects `bun.lock` (text format, Bun 1.2+) alongside the legacy `bun.lockb` binary format.
- **Worktree commit parsing hardened.** Edge case where `git log` lines with no space separator caused truncated hashes and wrong messages is now handled.
- **61 tests, 0 failures.** Up from 50 passing / 10 failing — the test suite now covers severity ranking, schema validation, confidence threshold propagation, and shell-safe worker templating.

## What Is Bug Hunter

Three AI agents argue about your code. One hunts for bugs. One tries to disprove every finding. One delivers the final verdict. Only bugs that survive all three stages make the report.

This eliminates the two biggest problems with AI code review: **false positive overload** (the Skeptic catches them) and **fixes that break things** (canary rollout with automatic rollback catches those).

## The Problem with AI Code Review

Traditional AI code review tools suffer from two persistent failure modes:

1. **False positive overload.** Developers waste hours triaging "bugs" that aren't real — the code is fine, or the framework already handles the edge case. This erodes trust and leads teams to ignore automated findings entirely.

2. **Fixes that introduce regressions.** Automated fixers often break working code because they lack full context — they don't understand the test suite, the framework's implicit behaviors, or the upstream dependencies.

Bug Hunter eliminates both problems:

- **False positives** are filtered through adversarial debate. The Hunter finds bugs, the Skeptic tries to disprove them with counter-evidence, and the Referee delivers an independent verdict — replicating the dynamics of a real multi-reviewer code review, but automated and reproducible.

- **Regressions from fixes** are prevented by a strategic fix pipeline that captures test baselines, applies canary rollouts, checkpoints every commit, auto-reverts failures, and re-scans fixed code for newly introduced bugs.

## How the Adversarial Pipeline Works

### Pipeline Architecture Overview

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/pipeline-overview.png" alt="Bug Hunter 8-stage adversarial pipeline architecture — Triage, Recon, Hunter deep scan, Documentation verification, Skeptic adversarial challenge, Referee independent verdict, Strategic fix plan, and Verification" width="100%">
</p>

The pipeline processes your code through eight sequential stages. Each stage feeds structured output to the next, creating a chain of evidence that eliminates noise and surfaces only confirmed, real bugs.

```
Your Code
    ↓
🔍 Triage          — Classifies files by risk in <2s, zero AI cost
    ↓
🗺️  Recon           — Maps tech stack, identifies high-risk attack surfaces
    ↓
🎯 Hunter          — Deep behavioral scan: logic errors, security holes, race conditions
    ↓                  ↕ verifies claims against official library documentation
🛡️  Skeptic         — Adversarial challenge: attempts to DISPROVE every finding
    ↓                  ↕ verifies dismissals against official documentation
⚖️  Referee         — Independent final judge: re-reads code, delivers verdict
    ↓
📋 Report          — Confirmed bugs only, with severity, STRIDE/CWE tags, CVSS scores
    ↓
📝 Fix Plan        — Strategic plan: priority ordering, canary rollout, safety gates
    ↓
🔧 Fixer           — Executes fixes sequentially on a dedicated git branch
    ↓                  ↕ checks documentation for correct API usage in patches
✅ Verify          — Tests every fix, reverts failures, re-scans for fixer-introduced bugs
```

### Adversarial Debate — Hunter vs Skeptic vs Referee

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/adversarial-debate.png" alt="Adversarial debate workflow diagram — Hunter agent reports bug findings, Skeptic agent attempts disproof with counter-evidence, Referee agent delivers independent verdict with confidence scoring" width="100%">
</p>

The core innovation is **structured adversarial debate** between agents with opposing incentives. This mirrors how real security teams operate — a penetration tester finds vulnerabilities, a defender challenges the findings, and a security architect makes the final call.

Each agent independently reads the source code. No agent trusts another's analysis — they verify claims by re-reading the actual code and checking official documentation.

### Agent Incentive Scoring System

| Agent | Earns Points For | Loses Points For |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 🎯 **Hunter** | Reporting real, confirmed bugs | Reporting false positives |
| 🛡️ **Skeptic** | Successfully disproving false positives | Dismissing real bugs (2× penalty) |
| ⚖️ **Referee** | Accurate, well-reasoned final verdicts | Blind trust in either Hunter or Skeptic |

This scoring creates a **self-correcting equilibrium**. The Hunter doesn't flood the report with low-quality findings because false positives reduce its score. The Skeptic doesn't dismiss everything because missing a real bug incurs a double penalty. The Referee can't rubber-stamp — it must independently verify.

## Features

### Bundled Local Security Skills

Bug Hunter now ships with a portable local security pack under `skills/`:
- `commit-security-scan`
- `security-review`
- `threat-model-generation`
- `vulnerability-validation`

These are bundled inside the repository so the system does not depend on external marketplace paths or machine-specific skill installs. They are adapted to Bug Hunter-native artifacts like `.bug-hunter/threat-model.md`, `.bug-hunter/security-config.json`, `.bug-hunter/findings.json`, and `.bug-hunter/referee.json`.

They are now wired into the main Bug Hunter flow:
- PR-focused security review routes into `commit-security-scan`
- `--threat-model` routes into `threat-model-generation`
- enterprise/full security review routes into `security-review`
- exploitability confirmation for security findings routes into `vulnerability-validation`

Bug Hunter remains the top-level orchestrator; the bundled skills are capability modules inside that orchestration.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/2026-03-12-security-pack.png" alt="Bundled local security pack banner — Bug Hunter orchestrates commit security scan, security review, threat-model generation, and vulnerability validation" width="100%">
</p>

### Zero-Token Triage — Instant File Classification

Before any AI agent runs, a lightweight Node.js script (`scripts/triage.cjs`) scans your entire codebase in **under 2 seconds**. It classifies every file by risk level — CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, or CONTEXT-ONLY — computes a token budget, and selects the optimal scanning strategy.

This means **zero wasted AI tokens** on file discovery and classification. A 2,000-file monorepo is triaged in the same time as a 10-file project.

The triage output drives every downstream decision: which files the Hunter reads first, how many parallel workers to spawn, and whether loop mode is needed for complete coverage.

### Deep Bug Hunting — Runtime Behavioral Analysis

The Hunter agent reads your code file-by-file, prioritized by risk level, and searches for bugs that cause **real problems at runtime**:

- **Logic errors** — wrong comparisons, off-by-one, inverted conditions, unreachable branches
- **Security vulnerabilities** — SQL injection, XSS, path traversal, IDOR, authentication bypass, SSRF
- **Race conditions** — concurrent access without synchronization, deadlock patterns, TOCTOU
- **Error handling gaps** — swallowed exceptions, unhandled promise rejections, missing edge cases
- **Data integrity issues** — silent truncation, encoding corruption, timezone mishandling, integer overflow
- **API contract violations** — type mismatches between callers and callees, incorrect callback signatures
- **Resource leaks** — unclosed database connections, file handles, event listeners, WebSocket connections

The Hunter does **not** report: code style preferences, naming conventions, unused variables, TODO comments, or subjective improvement suggestions. Only behavioral bugs that affect runtime correctness or security.

### Official Documentation Verification via Context Hub + Context7

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/doc-verify-fix-plan.png" alt="Documentation verification workflow — agents check official library docs via Context Hub and Context7 API before making claims, plus strategic fix planning timeline with canary rollout and checkpoint verification" width="100%">
</p>

AI models frequently make incorrect assumptions about library behavior — "Express sanitizes input by default" (it doesn't), "Prisma parameterizes `$queryRaw` automatically" (it depends on usage). These wrong assumptions produce both false positives and missed real bugs.

Bug Hunter solves this by **verifying claims against official documentation** via [Context Hub](https://github.com/andrewyng/context-hub) (curated, versioned docs) with [Context7](https://context7.com) as a fallback, before any agent makes an assertion about framework behavior.

#### Which Agents Verify Documentation and When

| Agent | Verification Trigger | Example Query |
|-------|---------------------|---------------|
| 🎯 **Hunter** | Claiming a framework lacks a protection | "Does Express.js escape HTML in responses?" → Express docs confirm it doesn't → XSS reported |
| 🛡️ **Skeptic** | Disproving a finding based on framework behavior | "Does Prisma parameterize `$queryRaw`?" → Prisma docs show tagged template parameterization → false positive dismissed |
| 🔧 **Fixer** | Implementing a fix using a library API | "Correct `helmet()` middleware pattern in Express?" → docs → fix uses documented API |

#### Documentation Verification in Practice

When the Hunter reports a potential SQL injection:

```
1. Hunter reads code: db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`)
2. Hunter queries: "Does node-postgres parameterize template literals?"
   → Runs: node doc-lookup.cjs get "/node-postgres/node-pg" "template literal queries"
   → pg docs: template literals are interpolated directly, NOT parameterized
3. Hunter reports: "SQL injection — per pg docs, template literals are string-interpolated"
```

When the Skeptic reviews the same finding:

```
1. Skeptic independently re-reads the source code
2. Skeptic queries the same documentation to verify the Hunter's claim
3. Skeptic confirms: "pg documentation agrees — this is a real injection vector"
4. Finding survives to Referee stage
```

#### Abuse Prevention Rules

- Agents only query docs for a **specific claim to verify** — not speculatively for every import
- **One lookup per claim** — no chained exploratory searches
- If the API returns nothing useful: "Could not verify from docs — proceeding based on code analysis only"
- Agents **cite their evidence**: "Per Express docs: [exact quote]" — so reasoning is auditable

#### Supported Ecosystem Coverage

Documentation verification works for any library available in [Context Hub](https://github.com/andrewyng/context-hub) (curated docs) or indexed by Context7 — covering the majority of popular packages across **npm, PyPI, Go modules, Rust crates, Ruby gems**, and more.

### Adversarial Skeptic with 15 Hard Exclusion Rules

The Skeptic doesn't rubber-stamp findings. It re-reads the actual source code for every reported bug and attempts to disprove it. Before deep adversarial analysis, it applies **15 hard exclusion rules** — settled false-positive categories that are instantly dismissed:

| # | Exclusion Rule | Rationale |
|---|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | DoS claims without demonstrated amplification | Theoretical only |
| 2 | Rate limiting concerns | Informational, not behavioral bugs |
| 3 | Memory safety in memory-safe languages | Rust safe code, Go, Java GC |
| 4 | Findings in test files | Test code, not production |
| 5 | Log injection concerns | Low-impact in most contexts |
| 6 | SSRF with attacker controlling only the path | Insufficient control for exploitation |
| 7 | LLM prompt injection | Out of scope for code review |
| 8 | ReDoS without a demonstrated >1s payload | Unproven impact |
| 9 | Documentation/config-only findings | Not runtime behavior |
| 10 | Missing audit logging | Informational, not a bug |
| 11 | Environment variables treated as untrusted | Server-side env is trusted |
| 12 | UUIDs treated as guessable | Cryptographically random by spec |
| 13 | Client-side-only auth checks with server enforcement | Server enforces correctly |
| 14 | Secrets on disk with proper file permissions | OS-level protection is sufficient |
| 15 | Memory/CPU exhaustion without external attack path | No exploitable entry point |

Findings that survive the exclusion filter receive full adversarial analysis: independent code re-reading, framework documentation verification, and confidence-gated verdicts.

### Few-Shot Calibration for Precision Tuning

Hunter and Skeptic agents receive **worked calibration examples** before scanning — real findings with complete analysis chains showing the expected reasoning quality:

- **Hunter examples**: 3 confirmed bugs (SQL injection, IDOR, command injection) + 2 correctly identified false positives
- **Skeptic examples**: 2 accepted real bugs + 2 correctly disproved false positives + 1 manual-review edge case

These examples calibrate agent judgment and establish the expected evidence standard for every finding.

### Automatic Codebase Scaling Strategies

Bug Hunter automatically selects the optimal scanning strategy based on your codebase size:

| Codebase Size | Strategy | Behavior |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| **1 file** | Single-file | Direct deep scan, zero overhead |
| **2–10 files** | Small | Quick recon + single deep pass |
| **11–60 files** | Parallel | Hybrid scanning with optional dual-lens verification |
| **60–120 files** | Extended | Sequential chunked scanning with progress checkpoints |
| **120–180 files** | Scaled | State-driven chunks with resume capability |
| **180+ files** | Large-codebase | Domain-scoped pipelines + boundary audits (loop mode, on by default) |

Loop mode is **on by default** — the pipeline runs iteratively until every queued scannable source file has been audited and, in fix mode, every discovered fixable bug has been processed. The agent should keep descending through CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW automatically unless the user interrupts. Use `--no-loop` for a single-pass scan.

---

## Security Classification — STRIDE, CWE, and CVSS

Every security finding is tagged with industry-standard identifiers, making Bug Hunter output compatible with professional security tooling, compliance frameworks, and vulnerability management platforms.

### STRIDE Threat Categorization

Each security bug is classified under one of the six STRIDE threat categories:

| Category | Threat Type | Example |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **S** — Spoofing | Identity falsification | Authentication bypass, JWT forgery |
| **T** — Tampering | Data modification | SQL injection, parameter manipulation |
| **R** — Repudiation | Action deniability | Missing audit logs for sensitive operations |
| **I** — Information Disclosure | Data leakage | Exposed API keys, verbose error messages |
| **D** — Denial of Service | Availability disruption | Unbounded queries, resource exhaustion |
| **E** — Elevation of Privilege | Unauthorized access escalation | IDOR, broken access control |

### CWE Weakness Identification

Findings include the specific [CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)](https://cwe.mitre.org/) identifier — the industry standard for classifying software weaknesses:

- **CWE-89** — SQL Injection
- **CWE-79** — Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **CWE-22** — Path Traversal
- **CWE-639** — Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- **CWE-78** — OS Command Injection
- **CWE-862** — Missing Authorization

CWE tags enable direct mapping to **OWASP Top 10**, **NIST NVD**, and compliance frameworks like **SOC 2** and **ISO 27001**.

### CVSS 3.1 Severity Scoring

Critical and high-severity security bugs receive a **CVSS 3.1 vector and numeric score** (0.0–10.0):

```
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N → 9.1 (Critical)
```

CVSS scores enable **risk-based prioritization** — teams can set CI/CD gates that block merges on findings above a threshold score.

### Enriched Referee Verdicts with Proof of Concept

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/security-finding-card.png" alt="Enriched security finding card showing bug ID, severity badge, STRIDE and CWE classification, CVSS 3.1 score ring, reachability and exploitability ratings, and proof of concept payload" width="100%">
</p>

For confirmed security bugs, the Referee enriches the verdict with professional-grade detail:

| Field | Description |
|-------|------------|
| **Reachability** | Can an external attacker reach this code path? (EXTERNAL / AUTHENTICATED / INTERNAL / UNREACHABLE) |
| **Exploitability** | How difficult is exploitation? (EASY / MEDIUM / HARD) |
| **CVSS 3.1 Score** | Numeric severity on the 0.0–10.0 scale with full vector string |
| **Proof of Concept** | Minimal benign PoC: payload, request, expected behavior, actual behavior |

#### Example Enriched Verdict

```
VERDICT: REAL BUG | Confidence: High
- Reachability:    EXTERNAL
- Exploitability:  EASY
- CVSS:            CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N (9.1)
- Proof of Concept:
  - Payload:   ' OR '1'='1
  - Request:   GET /api/users?search=test' OR '1'='1
  - Expected:  Returns matching users only
  - Actual:    Returns ALL users — SQL injection bypasses WHERE clause
```

## Threat Modeling with STRIDE

Run with `--threat-model` and Bug Hunter generates a comprehensive **STRIDE threat model** for your codebase:

- **Trust boundary mapping** — public → authenticated → internal service boundaries
- **Entry point identification** — HTTP routes, WebSocket handlers, queue consumers, cron jobs
- **Data flow analysis** — traces sensitive data from ingestion to storage to response
- **Tech-stack-specific patterns** — vulnerable vs. safe code examples for your exact framework versions

The threat model is saved to `.bug-hunter/threat-model.md` and automatically feeds into Hunter and Recon for more targeted analysis. Threat models are reused across runs and regenerated if older than 90 days.

---

## Dependency CVE Scanning

Run with `--deps` for **third-party vulnerability auditing**:

- **Package manager support**: npm, pnpm, yarn, bun (Node.js), pip (Python), go (Go), cargo (Rust)
- **Severity filtering**: only HIGH and CRITICAL CVEs — no noise from low-severity advisories
- **Lockfile-aware detection**: automatically identifies your package manager and runs the correct audit command
- **Reachability analysis**: scans your source code to determine if you actually *use* the vulnerable API — a vulnerable transitive dependency you never import is flagged as `NOT_REACHABLE`

Dependency findings are saved to `.bug-hunter/dep-findings.json` and cross-referenced by the Hunter when scanning your application code.

---

## Strategic Fix Planning and Safe Auto-Fix

Bug Hunter doesn't throw uncoordinated patches at your codebase. After the Referee confirms real bugs, the system builds a **strategic fix plan** with safety gates at every step — the difference between "an AI that edits files" and "an AI that engineers patches."

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/2026-03-12-fix-plan-rollout.png" alt="Strategic fix planning banner — strategy, confidence gating, canary rollout, verification, and rollback safety" width="100%">
</p>

### Phase 1 — Safety Setup and Git Branching

- Verifies you're in a git repository (warns if not — no rollback without version control)
- Captures current branch and commit hash as a **restore point**
- Stashes uncommitted changes safely — nothing is lost
- Creates a dedicated fix branch: `bug-hunter-fix-YYYYMMDD-HHmmss`
- Acquires a **single-writer lock** — prevents concurrent fixers from conflicting
- **Worktree isolation** (subagent/teams backends): Fixer runs in an isolated git worktree so edits never touch your working tree until verified — managed by `worktree-harvest.cjs` with automatic crash recovery

### Phase 2 — Test Baseline Capture

- Auto-detects your project's test, typecheck, and build commands
- Runs the test suite once to record the **passing baseline**
- This baseline is critical: if a fix causes a previously-passing test to fail, the fix is auto-reverted

### Phase 3 — Strategy Before Patching

Before the Fixer edits anything, Bug Hunter now writes a canonical `fix-strategy.json` artifact.
It clusters confirmed bugs and classifies them into one of four tracks:

- **safe-autofix** — localized enough for guarded patching
- **manual-review** — confidence too low for unattended edits
- **larger-refactor** — needs coordinated multi-file changes
- **architectural-remediation** — broad contract or design issue; report, don’t auto-edit

This makes the remediation plan visible before execution. Users who want review without mutation can run `--plan-only` to stop after strategy + plan generation.

### Phase 4 — Confidence-Gated Fix Queue

- **75% confidence gate**: only bugs the Referee confirmed with ≥75% confidence are auto-fixed
- Bugs below the threshold are marked `MANUAL_REVIEW` — reported but never auto-edited
- **Conflict resolution**: same-file bugs are grouped and ordered to prevent overlapping edits
- **Severity ordering**: Critical → High → Medium → Low

### Phase 5 — Canary Rollout Strategy

```
Fix Plan: 7 eligible bugs | canary: 2 | rollout: 5 | manual-review: 3

Canary Phase:
  BUG-1 (CRITICAL) → fix SQL injection in users.ts:45 → commit → test → ✅ pass
  BUG-2 (CRITICAL) → fix auth bypass in auth.ts:23 → commit → test → ✅ pass
  Canary passed — continuing rollout

Rollout Phase:
  BUG-3 (HIGH) → fix XSS in template.ts:89 → commit → test → ✅ pass
  BUG-4 (MEDIUM) → fix race condition in queue.ts:112 → commit → test → ❌ FAIL
    → Auto-reverting BUG-4 fix → re-test → ✅ pass (failure cleared)
    → BUG-4 status: FIX_REVERTED
  BUG-5 (MEDIUM) → fix error swallow in api.ts:67 → commit → test → ✅ pass
```

The 1–3 highest-severity bugs are fixed first as a **canary group**. If canary fixes break tests, the entire fix pipeline halts — no further changes are applied. If canaries pass, remaining fixes roll out sequentially with per-fix checkpoints.

### Phase 5 — Post-Fix Verification and Re-Scan

After all fixes are applied, three verification steps run:

1. **Full test suite** — compared against the baseline to surface any new failures
2. **Typecheck and build** — catches compile-time errors the fixer may have introduced
3. **Post-fix re-scan** — a lightweight Hunter re-scans ONLY the lines the Fixer changed, specifically looking for bugs the Fixer itself introduced (e.g., an off-by-one in new validation logic)

### Fix Status Reference

Every bug receives a final status after the fix pipeline completes:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **FIXED** | Patch applied, all tests pass, no fixer-introduced regressions |
| **FIX_REVERTED** | Patch applied but caused test failure — cleanly auto-reverted |
| **FIX_FAILED** | Patch caused failures and could not be cleanly reverted — needs manual intervention |
| **PARTIAL** | Minimal patch applied, but a larger refactor is needed for complete resolution |
| **SKIPPED** | Bug confirmed but fix not attempted (too risky, architectural scope, etc.) |
| **FIXER_BUG** | Post-fix re-scan detected that the Fixer introduced a new bug |
| **MANUAL_REVIEW** | Referee confidence below 75% — reported but not auto-fixed |

### Documentation-Verified Fixes

The Fixer verifies correct API usage by querying official documentation before implementing patches:

```
Example: Fixing SQL injection (BUG-1)

1. Fixer reads Referee verdict: "SQL injection via string concatenation in pg query"
2. Fixer queries: "Correct parameterized query pattern in node-postgres?"
   → Runs: node doc-lookup.cjs get "/node-postgres/node-pg" "parameterized queries"
   → pg docs: Use db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [userId])
3. Fixer implements the documented pattern — not a guess from training data
4. Checkpoint commit → tests run → pass ✅
```

This prevents a common failure: the Fixer "fixing" a bug using an API pattern that doesn't exist or behaves differently than expected.

</p>

Every run produces machine-readable output at `.bug-hunter/findings.json` for pipeline automation:

```json

        "expected": "Returns matching users only",
        "actual": "Returns ALL users (SQL injection)"
      }
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total_reported": 12,
    "confirmed": 5,
    "dismissed": 7,
    "by_severity": { "CRITICAL": 2, "HIGH": 1, "MEDIUM": 1, "LOW": 1 },
    "by_stride": { "Tampering": 2, "InfoDisclosure": 1, "ElevationOfPrivilege": 2 }
  }
}
```

Use this output for **CI/CD pipeline gating** (block merges on CRITICAL findings), **security dashboards** (Grafana, Datadog), or **automated ticket creation** (Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues).

## Output Files Reference

Every run creates a `.bug-hunter/` directory (add to `.gitignore`) containing:

| File | Generated | Contents |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `report.md` | Always | Human-readable report: confirmed bugs, dismissed findings, coverage stats |
| `findings.json` | Always | Machine-readable JSON for CI/CD and dashboards |
| `skeptic.json` | When findings exist | Canonical Skeptic challenge artifact |
| `referee.json` | When findings exist | Canonical Referee verdict artifact |

| `recon.md` | Always | Tech stack analysis, attack surface mapping, scan order |
| `findings.md` | Optional | Markdown companion rendered from `findings.json` |
| `skeptic.md` | Optional | Markdown companion rendered from `skeptic.json` |
| `referee.md` | Optional | Markdown companion rendered from `referee.json` |
| `coverage.md` | Loop/autonomous runs | Markdown companion rendered from `coverage.json` |
| `fix-strategy.json` | When findings exist | Canonical remediation strategy: safe autofix vs manual review vs refactor vs architectural work |
| `fix-strategy.md` | When findings exist | Markdown companion rendered from `fix-strategy.json` |
| `fix-plan.json` | Plan/fix mode | Canonical execution plan for canary rollout, gating, and safe fix order |

## Supported Languages and Frameworks

**Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, Kotlin, Ruby, PHP

**Frameworks:** Express, Fastify, Next.js, Django, Flask, FastAPI, Gin, Echo, Actix, Spring Boot, Rails, Laravel — and any framework indexed by Context7 for documentation verification.

The pipeline adapts to whatever it finds. Triage classifies files by extension and risk patterns; Hunter and Skeptic agents adjust their security checklists based on the detected tech stack.

## CLI Flags Reference

| Flag | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| *(no flags)* | Scan current directory, auto-fix confirmed bugs |

| `--review` | Easy alias for `--scan-only` |
| `--fix` | Find and auto-fix bugs (default behavior) |
| `--plan-only` | Build `fix-strategy.json` + fix plan, then stop before the fixer edits code |

| `--safe` | Easy alias for `--fix --approve` |
| `--autonomous` | Full auto-fix with zero intervention |
| `--dry-run` | Preview planned fixes without editing files — outputs diff previews and `fix-report.json` |
| `--preview` | Easy alias for `--fix --dry-run` |
| `--loop` | Iterative mode — runs until 100% queued source-file coverage **(on by default)** |
| `--no-loop` | Disable loop mode — single-pass scan only |
| `--deps` | Include dependency CVE scanning with reachability analysis |
| `--threat-model` | Generate or use STRIDE threat model for targeted security analysis |
| `--security-review` | Run the bundled enterprise security-review workflow with threat model + CVE + validation context |
| `--validate-security` | Force vulnerability-validation for confirmed security findings |

All flags compose: `/bug-hunter --deps --threat-model --fix src/`

## Self-Test and Validation

Bug Hunter ships with a test fixture containing an Express app with **6 intentionally planted bugs** (2 Critical, 3 Medium, 1 Low):

The repository also ships with **61 Node.js regression tests** covering orchestration, schemas, PR scope resolution, fix-plan validation, lock behavior, worktree lifecycle, severity ranking, and the bundled local security-skill routing.

```bash
/bug-hunter test-fixture/
```

**Expected benchmark results:**
- ✅ All 6 bugs found by Hunter
- ✅ At least 1 false positive challenged and dismissed by Skeptic
- ✅ All 6 planted bugs confirmed by Referee

**Calibration thresholds:** If fewer than 5 of 6 are found, prompts need tuning. If more than 3 false positives survive to Referee, the Skeptic prompt needs tightening.
